<h2>Daan Jensen</h2>
<h1>Three Visits</h1>
<h3>a requiem</h3>
<p>published in <a href="issue-2.html">Issue II: Nerves</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
In the waving grass<br>
and under passing clouds<br>
there is a place without a crowd<br>
where I can go to<br>
any given day<br>
a little private moment<br>
no talking today<br>
the closest place to heaven<br>
that I have ever been<br>
if there is a place on earth<br>
it’s here she can be seen<br>&nbsp;<br>
and I think it is the day<br>
for all that I hold dear<br>
The noises and the rubble<br>
gently fade away<br>
I stand still and see it happen<br>
Everything gets clear<br>
and with me all my troubles<br>
silently disappear<br>
now there seems no difference<br>
between happiness and fear<br>&nbsp;<br>
I walk the forrest’s nerves<br>
and their lights shine through my mind<br>
the dark in and all around<br>
is turning neutral and rewind<br>
strangely familiar present<br>
first time I found<br>
its a state of mind I’ve never been<br>
like a different deliverance<br>
as if it were a dream<br>&nbsp;<br>
both in and around me<br>
it offers me no choice<br>
it shivers through me<br>
I can hear her voice<br>
not a single worry<br>
nothing she preserves<br>
cleaned my ears with certainty<br>
stillness she assures<br>
cleanses and whispers<br>
blessings in my ears<br>
mother nature’s clarity<br>
wash my head with tears<br>&nbsp;<br>
now one single pine leaf<br>
assures me I can say<br>
the way as it has been since birth<br>
is the peace thats in me<br>
and will never go away<br>
the wind that blows around me<br>
is showing me the way<br>
recon that it bares her face<br>
and I know that it will stay<br>
a sight so immaculately clean<br>
where in my eyes<br>
the blood stains<br>
bluntly turn to cream<br>&nbsp;<br>
all four seasons<br>
in one single glance<br>
close my eyes<br>
my pupils stare in trance<br>
it seems so great and empty<br>
my heart skips a beat<br>
behold all that is left to fill<br>
the hilltop is my seat<br>
the streets are all sweaty<br>
the asphalt stains my feet<br>
given a path that’s woven<br>
so perfectly<br>
while the water here is frozen<br>
the sun touches my lips<br>
the vast field slips open<br>
some thoughts grow weary<br>
and other hearts get broken<br>
all of that is too far<br>
from me away<br>
I’m just like that nature<br>
taking it day by day<br>&nbsp;<br>
my nose with your smells<br>
is dancing in the sky<br>
my thoughts seemed so confused<br>
but now I cant remember why<br>
in this place I am with you<br>
and I am here too<br>
smiling<br>
breathing<br>
dying<br>
been that way<br>
my whole life long<br>
and will be that way<br>
till the day I die<br>
and thats all okay<br>
just remembered why<br>
more than ever I am living now<br>
every single day<br>
I only have to try<br>&nbsp;<br>
I take the same old path again<br>
but this time in reverse<br>
although I’ve been walking this way<br>
for at least while<br>
the way that I see it now<br>
is another first<br>
it makes every inch<br>
feel as long as a feet<br>
so I am walking right beside you now<br>
in this place where we always used<br>
and will always meet<br>
your moss and sands gently pet my feet<br>
and so for the coming while<br>
you bring on my face<br>
 your ever-loving smile<br>&nbsp;<br>
and together<br>
we go on<br>
always<br>
and always<br>
with that smile<br>
we will walk along
