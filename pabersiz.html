<h2>Jonas Pabersiz</h2>
<h1>untitled</h1>
<p>published in <a href="issue-2.html">Issue II: Nerves</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
Crashing down the cities waves of endless cars and screams wash away the fear...<br>
But not yet the guilt that causes me to spasm in my dreams tomorrow.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Naaaah.<br>&nbsp;<br>
That’s not what I really want to write.<br>
It feels heavy, and slithering<br>
because it truly is so trite.<br>&nbsp;<br>
What I write is what I feel and what I feel:<br>
is just as fast.<br>
And loud.<br>
As my angry fucking blood pump feels right now!<br>&nbsp;<br>
So a verbal diarrhea seems inevitable<br>
and though I’m cautious of what’s to see there,<br>
I’m nauseous to just sit here.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Seldom do I sell my sonnet seconds superseding<br>
the start...<br>&nbsp;<br>
But let’s begin:<br>
It’s called “Shallows”.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Symbolism and crude metaphors.<br>
Simply listening to lewd heteros.<br>
Silly schism mixtures, farragos.<br>&nbsp;<br>
And I curse and I pray<br>
so right now I could say<br>
that this way that I chose<br>
to go on and the clothes<br>
I show are shallow.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Just be quiet and listen.<br>
It’s my time to insist on<br>
saying a word or two<br>
so that this world might too<br>
hear me out for once.<br>
Instead of all the cunts<br>
that shout of their own pain,<br>
and their own ways,<br>
and their own gains.<br>
And the way they worked and the way they played.<br>
From the days they layed inside relaxing<br>
to the day they layed outside distracted<br>
by the boom of a gun in the distance<br>
followed with their own body insisting<br>
to rest a bit, to close their eyes,<br>
growing cold and verie of lies.<br>&nbsp;<br>
The lies.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Wait so cold and stiff.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Demise —<br>
cuts of quick like an edge of a cliff.<br>&nbsp;<br>
And I curse and I pray<br>
so right now I could say<br>
that this way that I chose<br>
to go on and the clothes<br>
I show are shallow.<br>&nbsp;<br>
I’ve come to notice<br>
that I’ve done my quotas<br>
on swearing a lot.<br>
Not swearing to God.<br>
But swearing to you,<br>
just swearing the truth<br>
and sweating my youth away.<br>
When you cry out for me<br>
I want to be there<br>
but at times I am scared<br>
or worse: without a care —<br>
acurse that I do bear.<br>
But not a curse like<br>
a fucker or pussy!<br>
I’m a fuck up can’t you see?<br>
These words are so jucy<br>
and delicious to say<br>
but malicious and fake.<br>&nbsp;<br>
I inhale again<br>
start to pretend<br>
that I’m ok,<br>
that I’m alright,<br>
that I will make it<br>
through the night.<br>
That I won’t think of damned dark demons<br>
making cuts and bloody lesions<br>
in my mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>
My mind’s eye is blind!<br>&nbsp;<br>
“Oh my God, it sounds so dope.”<br>
But on these words I’m sure to choke.<br>&nbsp;<br>
And I curse and I pray<br>
so right now I could say<br>
that this way that I chose<br>
to go on and the clothes<br>
I show are shallow...
