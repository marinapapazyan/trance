<h2>Tereza Nováková</h2>
<h1>AirTravel</h1>
<p>published in <a href="issue-2.html">Issue II: Nerves</a>
<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
Little lady, little bluer,<br>
cheering your very own noise,<br>
you as the visitor<br>
me as the viewer.<br>
Nervous, as well as horrified,<br>
she had her eyes on me,<br>
she was my honey guide,<br>
oh boy, dead replied.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Your senses have noticed this pain,<br>
inner and truly yours.<br>
You called it daydreaming, the migraine,<br>
inverted preserved cloudy desolation.<br>
Just the crappy grain,<br>
experiencing this sensation.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Once I carried my head,<br>
no more trusting my eyes,<br>
this snake entered my body,<br>
Please, lets don’t do this twice,<br>
super sneaky—super ugly.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
First, it was my ear, oh my dear,<br>
then reaching the curved jaw,<br>
her young milk teeth.<br>
Crushing my pale cheeks,<br>
likely pulling my only self<br>
along with desirable fear.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Beneath visible illusion,<br>
thus quite severe,<br>
my private view mistake,<br>
stomach for heart and jaws for soul.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Filling, tripping, disappearing,<br>
no way, the snake is here in a minute,<br>
just crawling into my eye into my head.<br>
It’s not just pure pain,<br>
it’s pure pain being,<br>
breathing existing<br>
like a hurricane.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I make sure that I remember who am I<br>
where am I going.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Alone, sitting in the middle of chaos,<br>
they suddenly looked through my eyes.<br>
Me pretending to sense the calmness,<br>
laying down my face into my palms.<br>
I beg, they belong together to be honest.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Hearing virtuous grain, silently murmuring:<br>
just few seconds, at that right place.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But those muddy seconds,<br>
suggested the sacred stroke itself<br>
After one hour, I unstick my hands,<br>
looking at them, at my perished face.<br>&nbsp;<br>
I seem to be bleeding, I cried.<br>
Again, making properly sure,<br>
ok, I remember who am I.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Trying to wake my feet up, my hands,<br>
move one move the other,<br>
still locked in the seat I think about mother,<br>
I feel my stomach I feel my heart.<br>&nbsp;<br>
They both keep on beating,<br>
primarily me, the functioning innocent life.<br>
Hell has two types of turbulences,<br>
including talking people around.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Not being able to chase those voices,<br>
unaware, acting pretending the absence,<br>
I try to ask myself again,<br>
who is she<br>
is she happy?<br>&nbsp;<br>
She whispered to my painful ear,<br>
moreover the answer hurt even more.<br>
There was no need to meet her eyes,<br>
never required, that’s what she asked for.<br>
What stayed was just the feeling<br>
of my stomach and her heart.<br>
Soon after it gets dark<br>
I make claim to stay alive.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Counting from ten to one in my native language,<br>
no no no, not right,<br>
who is she,<br>
who am I,<br>
am I happy?<br>&nbsp;<br>
Imagine yourself on the sofa of your parents,<br>
it’s perfeclly empty there,<br>
although one snake in this entire house<br>
waiting for the right moment,<br>
just there.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Freaked out with the tears on the face,<br>
not yours just coming from the same body.<br>
Over and over, not able to move,<br>
asking her,<br>
where is she,<br>
does she survive?<br>
The snake explains to her<br>
thanks the grain.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Paralysed thus vomiting<br>
your memory out to the world,<br>
giving the life, dying at the same time.<br>
Then celebrating, surviving the birth,<br>
side by side in control of this crime.<br>&nbsp;<br>
The act of something new,<br>
of forgotten love of you.<br>
Spreading together with the roots of trees,<br>
answering: It’s fucking spring, summer coming,<br>
isn’t this time of thank you?<br>&nbsp;<br>
They admire you, you look through,<br>
rubbing your hands touching your forehead<br>
nervously coughing, formerly smiling<br>
pretending invisibility.<br>
Rejection is the devil,<br>
after all, she told you.<br>
Snake crawling closer,<br>
frozen and scared, still daring breathing,<br>
closely listening, exposed to her.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Horribly crying, no it’s not you,<br>
it’s just another fever, another misery,<br>
unconventional feelings of happiness.<br>
Smelling burned betrayal, yes,<br>
that’s from you.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Now over here, desolation,<br>
we were used to be one, not two.<br>
The snake spoke ready,<br>
twisting on your sofa,<br>
very tired - very bended,<br>
crunched in the corner unsteady.<br>
Gently rubbing her toes I glance him<br>
and demand again,<br>
why is she?<br>&nbsp;<br>
The snake turns to me very slowly,<br>
mouth full of the shiny sharp teeth,<br>
in the eyes I can read blue<br>
instead of the dirty darkness.<br>
Describing to me, that the heaven<br>
has colours of the pastel candy.<br>
And just like that the hell stays black,<br>
you recognize this familiar feeling.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Fresh tears in her eyes reading<br>
in the darkness they see the most.<br>
The snake comes over, whispering,<br>
the darkness is your key coast.<br>&nbsp;<br>
At this moment I close my eyes<br>
I guess I’ll never open,<br>
we sail together into angel dust,<br>
into far astray to the deepest blue.<br>
Surrounded by confidence and trust,<br>
surrounded by each other.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Our skin blends, we certainly ally,<br>
while the snake spins in her palms<br>
palms of my hand, full of her mouldy water,<br>
overflowing, full of me.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Falling into the darkness,<br>
seeing more than I could see.<br>
Nervously welcoming the snake:<br>
who is she,<br>
she has a broken heart,<br>
she is the snake.
